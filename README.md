# Locality

This project is the beginnings of a project called Locality. It's a place for Farmers and Stores to connect. 
Farmers that are too small to be a part of distribution networks can use Locality to find customers. 
Stores can use Locality to find local products. 
Support small business!

This project exhibits input validation and Has-A relationships.
